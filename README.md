# Clicky-Game
 A memory game with React. Created by breaking up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

# What it does
The application renders 12 different images of madagascar characters. The user plays the game by clicking on one of the images. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is then reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
